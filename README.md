# Soft Actor Critic for magnetic microrobot control


Welcome to the official repository for _Smart Magnetic Microrobots Learn to Swim with Deep Reinforcement Learning._ This repository contains all the code used to implement a feedback control system for a helical agar magnetic microrobot and custom three-axis electromagnet.  The full paper can be found HERE. This code was developed in Windows 10 using Python VERSION Tensorflow VERISON. This code was developed on a Lambda Labs workstation with dual NVIDIA RTX1080 GPUs.
